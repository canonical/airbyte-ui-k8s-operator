# Contributing

To make contributions to this charm, you'll need a working
[development setup](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/dev-setup).

You can create an environment for development with `tox`:

```shell
tox devenv -e integration
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Testing

This project uses `tox` for managing test environments. There are some
pre-configured environments that can be used for linting and formatting code
when you're preparing contributions to the charm:

```shell
tox run -e format        # update your code according to linting rules
tox run -e lint          # code style
tox run -e static        # static type checking
tox run -e unit          # unit tests
tox run -e integration   # integration tests
tox                      # runs 'format', 'lint', 'static', and 'unit' environments
```
